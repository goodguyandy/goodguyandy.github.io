WpSauron is a simple script that helps the penetration tester aid secured wordpress websites. 

> It usefull when you have to perform static/dynamic code analysis against plugins and secured wordpress sites. 



* Wordpress core is updated 
* Plugin/themes updates are automatic 
* a WAF is in place and you cannot send to many requests
* You tried everything else and static/dinamically code analysis is your last resort 



## How it works

1. You give wpsauron a wordpress website url 
2. WpSauron fetches waybackmachines and grep plugins name 
3. WpSauron downloades all the found plugins 
4. WpSauron creates a Ready-To-Use Docker-compose
5. You can now perform static-dynamic analysis against the plugins, without sending a single request  

## installation

1. clone the repo:
[github](https://github.com/goodguyandy/wpsauron)

2. create a virtual env and install requirements

```python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. launch the script

```
usage: wpsauron.py [-h] [--subdomains] domain

Passively scan a wordpress site and grabs installed plugins. Then creates a test

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  --subdomains  include subdomains in the initial passive scan
