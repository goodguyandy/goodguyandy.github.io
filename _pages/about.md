Oh, Hello there! 👋 Happy to see you! 

My name is Andrea and I love to break stuff. I'm a penetration tester and damn curious about the world 🌍

I have some **certifications** under my belt: _OSCP, OSWE,  OSEP , CRTP , CRTE , RTO, eCXD, SLAE32, SLAE64_


My main area of interests are:

*  Appsec
*  Windows Internals

*  Offensive tools development 
*  Red Teaming & Offensive security in general
