Oh, Hello there! 👋 Happy to see you! 

My name is Andrea and I love to break stuff. I'm a penetration tester, developer and damn curious about the world 🌍

I'm a perpetual learner and in this blog you will find some of my research, experiments, notes and memes in the **infosecurity** field.  

I have some **certifications** under my belt: 

_From offensive security_:
*  **OSCP** 
* **OSWE**
* **OSEP**  
  
 From Ine / Pentester academy / zeropoint security :

* **CRTP**
* **CRTE**
* **RTO** 
* **eCXD** 
* **SLAE32** 
* **SLAE64**


My main area of interests are:

*  Appsec
*  Windows Internals 
*  _Layer8_ 
*  Offensive tools development 
*  Red Teaming & Offensive security in general
