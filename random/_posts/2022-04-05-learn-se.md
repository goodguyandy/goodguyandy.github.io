title:  "Learning Social Engineering Ethically"
---


During the years, I read a lot of books about  Social Engineering and Behavioral psychology. 

However, I always felt like I wasn't actually learning much, as I always felt not ethical to pratice SE in real life outside assesment. The sensation was  was like pretending to learn  football by reading books about it. Useless.  

Then I discovered an awesome art where, one hour a week, you can actually pratice SE in an ethical and safe  way: **Improvisational theatre**

> Improvisational theatre, often called improvisation or improv, is the form of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written script.
